# Robotic System Design using Software Engineering Models

This document outlines the design of a robotic system using various software engineering models, including context, interaction, structural, behavioral, and model-driven engineering models.

## 1. Context Model

The context model shows the environment in which the robotic system operates and how it interacts with external entities.

### Events:
1. **Power On** - The robot is powered up.
2. **Receive Command** - The robot receives a command from a user or a control system.
3. **Battery Low** - The robot detects a low battery level.
4. **Obstacle Detected** - The robot's sensors detect an obstacle.
5. **Shutdown** - The robot is powered down.

## 2. Interaction Model

The interaction model details the interactions between the system components and with external entities.

### Events:
1. **User Issues Command** - The user sends a command to the robot.
2. **Sensor Sends Data** - The sensors send data to the control unit.
3. **Control Unit Processes Data** - The control unit processes the sensor data.
4. **Control Unit Sends Instructions** - The control unit sends movement instructions to the motors.
5. **Robot Executes Movement** - The robot executes the movement based on the instructions.

## 3. Structural Model

The structural model shows the organization of the system in terms of components and their relationships.

### Events:
1. **Initialize System** - Initialize the components at startup.
2. **Connect Sensors** - Establish communication with sensors.
3. **Link Control Unit and Motors** - Connect the control unit to the motors.
4. **Activate Communication Module** - Activate the module for receiving commands.
5. **Check System Integrity** - Periodic checks for the systemâ€™s integrity.

## 4. Behavioral Model

The behavioral model describes the dynamic behavior of the system, typically using state diagrams or activity diagrams.

### Events:
1. **Standby State** - The robot is in standby waiting for commands.
2. **Processing Command State** - The robot processes a received command.
3. **Navigating State** - The robot is navigating to a target location.
4. **Obstacle Avoidance State** - The robot avoids an obstacle.
5. **Charging State** - The robot is in the charging state when battery is low.

## 5. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)

MDE uses models as primary artifacts throughout the engineering process. Here, we develop and transform models to generate the system.

### Events:
1. **Define Use Case Models** - Define use case models for the robotic system.
2. **Create Platform Independent Model (PIM)** - Create a high-level, platform-independent model.
3. **Transform PIM to Platform Specific Model (PSM)** - Transform the PIM into a PSM.
4. **Generate Code from PSM** - Generate the executable code from the PSM.
5. **Deploy and Test System** - Deploy the system and perform tests.
